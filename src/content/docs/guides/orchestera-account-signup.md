To use Orchestera Platform, you would first need to create an account.

## Account Sign Up
You can sign up for a free account by clicking the "Log In" button in the top right corner of the screen.

Currently, the only supported sign up method is GitHub, but more will be supported in future.

The sign up flow will ask for some basic details along with a name of your organization. If you are signing up for personal use, you may specify `Personal` in the Organization field.

üìù Note: If you were invited by another user to join an Organization, you will be prompted to join that organization first before creating your own. We currently only allow a single account association per email associated with your Github. This limits the account setup as follows:

- If you select the invite from another user during the sign up process, your acccount email will get associated with the Organization that invited you.
- If you reject the invitation during sign up, you can proceed with creating a personal account. However, this would mean that you will not be able to join another Organization with the same email.
- If you have a personal account and you also want to join an Organization account, you will need another Github account.
